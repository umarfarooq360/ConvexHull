# Convex Hull Java Project

###Overview
 This program finds the Convex Hull of a given set of points. 
Given set of N points in the Euclidean plane,the minimum area convex region that contains every point is the Convex Hull.Imagine the points are nails perpendicular to plane, stretch an elastic rubber bound around all points; it will minimize length. 

The program implements the Graham Scan algorithm to find the convex hull.
